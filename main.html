        <h2>What is Covid-19?</h2>
        <p>Coronavirus is a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS and COVID-19, which is causing an ongoing pandemic</p>
        </div>
        <div class="schild">
        <h2>How it spreads?</h2>
        <p>The virus can spread from an infected person's mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough. You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are near someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth. The virus spreads more easily indoors and in crowded settings.</p>

        <h1>What have we realized while experiencing this kind of problem in the world?</h1>
        <p>Everyone of us experiences challenges in our daily lives. Those challenges have become tougher because of this COVID-19 pandemic. Due to lockdown, many of us are just in our houses to avoid being infected and for the safety of our families. It's been 2 years and a half since the virus attack. As a student, I've realized a lot of things for myself. I became able to reconstruct myself to be better even without the interaction of the outside world. Because of boredom, I discovered my new hobby, which is programming. This helps me be prepared for my college course. Because the number of people using transportation decreased as a result of the pandemic, our mother nature was also healed. The pollution decreased, which gave nature a rest for a short period of time. That's also what actually happened to all of us. This pandemic gave us the opportunity to have more time with our family, which helped us deal with stress and anxiety. In every problem we face, there's a god that will help us overcome them. Let's just always talk to him and do some prayers to be able to say what's in our hearts. But always remember that in every prayer, there should be an action from us.</p>
